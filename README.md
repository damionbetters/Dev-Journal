# Dev-Journal
My daily dev journal: logging what I learn, build, break, and fix while I become a full-stack engineer. Bascially, this is where I will talk about my web-devloper journey.  I will try to write something, anything EVERY business/work day. That will then be used to crete YouTube videos for a weekly vlog. <br />
