IWe were working on building forms and right when we finished the array.form section of the form, I noticed the page (which is a SPA) would keep refreshing on its own. So, I went to chatgpt.com adn asked why it did that and it said you may be missing preventDefault. So he explained what that was and how to use it and I made a mental note of it, since this was only a learning app. And then the darndest thing happened, I went back to continue the lecture and Jonas said something like "if you notice, the page refreshed there. And you may be wondering why since this is a SPA, well thats because we are missing the preventDefault funciton.
