#### Today started out great. I absolutely nailed my morning routine today. Started the day off great which carried over into work. I didnt even plan to code today I felt I could get more done that I initially thought. My focus and energy are on point today.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Passing the argument directly as prop instead of passing a prop and the calling prop."whatever" later to use that data. Which reinforced my thoughts of props being just like parameters/arguments.
- When to use React fragments, basically use it when you add a new element to existing code and you do not want to mess up your CSS styling.
- You can add a ternary operation to a class using JSX in React.
- Review core JSX/React concepts that the Jonas Schmedtmann course covered so far.

### 🛠️ What I Built
- Moved more JSX to create a new component.

### 🧨 What Confused Me
- Using a ternary operator to determine when to add a class to an element.

### ✅ How I Solved It / What I Realized
- You have to use a template literal in the className value. Then, when you are adding the class names, use a JS expression (ie ternary operator) to determine when to add the name. So, Jonas used: <li className={`food ${foodObject.soldOut ? "sold-out" : ""}`}> which is dope.
- I realized that you aren't really using JS as a seperate file in IRL coding, you are just incorporating it into existing code. So, you really learn all HTML, CSS JS, and JSX but you are kind of blending them all together. Which is why spereation of concerns is paramount.

### 📌 Next Up
- TODOs for tomorrow
