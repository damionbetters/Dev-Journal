#### Today started out great. I absolutely nailed my morning routine today. Started the day off great which carried over into work. I didnt even plan to code today I felt I could get more done that I initially thought. My focus and energy are on point today.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Passing the argument directly as prop instead of passing a prop and the calling prop."whatever" later to use that data. Which reinforced my thoughts of props being just like parameters/arguments.
- When to use React fragments, basically use it when you add a new element to existing code and you do not want to mess up your CSS styling.

### 🛠️ What I Built
- Moved more JSX to create a new component.

### 🧨 What Confused Me
- Weird bugs, new syntax, broken docs

### ✅ How I Solved It / What I Realized
- Explain it like future-you is dumb

### 📌 Next Up
- TODOs for tomorrow
