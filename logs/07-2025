### 🧠 What I Learned
- Concepts, tools, “aha” moments
1.) Render one food element for each object, in the imported FoodData array by using .map().
Doing so will create a new array with new food components that will have the current food object using props.
2.) Conditional rednering which is when you use conditional operators to determine if and/or when a component will be rendered.
