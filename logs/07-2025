### 🧠 What I Learned
- Concepts, tools, “aha” moments
Today, the goal was to render one food element for each object, in the imported FoodData array by using .map(). Doing so will create a new array with new food components that will have the current food object using props.

### 🛠️ What I Built
- Features added, bugs fixed

### 🧨 What Confused Me
- Weird bugs, new syntax, broken docs

### ✅ How I Solved It / What I Realized
- Explain it like future-you is dumb

### 📌 Next Up
