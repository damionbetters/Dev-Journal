#### Focus and energy are wrecked today. Had to go run errands early in the morning with my nephew and niece and they were intentionally being annoying this morning. COMPLETELY drained me. Like, my body actually feels fatigued. Like I did a full cardio set this morning.
P.S. apparently, I did not do any work yesterday. Did not even noticed until just now.

### 🧠 What I Learned
How to use terniary conditionals, multiple returns, and extracting JSX into components. At this point everything is 
pretty much the same as JS, you just kind of nest things together. Well, actually you seperate different levels of 
the nest into self containing components (in React) and use props like a parameter/arguments to pass things along.

### 🛠️ What I Built
- Changed the Food and Menu components to match what we learned in this module.

### 🧨 What Confused Me
- Nothing really, it was super straight forward. I would have kept going but I was so drained.

### ✅ How I Solved It / What I Realized
- I realized that a lot of these syntax usages are pretty much semantics. There are not really relavent because you can
look up syntax from multiple sources. It's really the logic that you should be concerned with. Now, I get why MCC started
me off with a programming logic course. I also see why they used Python in that course. Geez, could you imagine taking
a logic course using a C-suite language. Good luck.

### 📌 Next Up
- I want to hit it hard tomorrow, which works out perfect because those children will not be here tomorrow.
- I want to finish the section, which includes destructuring components and setting classes.
- I also want to create an app from scratch to really reinforce what I have learned so far.
- Then I can take a look at a few (not too many) of my older modules that I feel I can use in the future and kind of update them.
