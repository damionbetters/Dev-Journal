#### Today was a super light day. It's Monday and both my energy and focus are terrible today. That coupled with my nephew and niece being here really did not bode well for productivity occuring today.

### 🧠 What I Learned
1.) Render one food element for each object, in the imported FoodData array by using .map().
Doing so will create a new array with new food components that will have the current food object using props.
2.) Conditional rednering which is when you use conditional operators to determine if and/or when a component will be rendered.

### 🛠️ What I Built
- Continued with the Food App. Added conditional rendering to determine when a food component should be displayed. 
I also used the map function, similar to the forEach function, to iterate through items in an object and props to pass data to a component. 
Which is useful because it allows for dynamic component rendering using API calls and/or imported data.

### 🧨 What Confused Me
- The synatx of props. You have to treat props almost as if you are parsing the data to use it.

### ✅ How I Solved It / What I Realized
- I basically created a variable in the menu function to pass the foodObject prop to the render food function to access each item in the object.
- Creting YouTube videos is a lot. I may really think about if I want to do it or not.

### 📌 Next Up
- More conditional rendering, with ternaries and multiple returns. Also, may tackle extracting JSX into a new component and
deconstructing props & setting classes and text conditionally if there is time.
