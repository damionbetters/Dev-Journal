#### This week was another rough one, but school is almost here so hopefully it will minimize the distractions. We are going to pick up where we left off with the forms and close out section six of Jonas' React course. I'm looking forward to learning how to modularize my code properly. Jonas mentioned that we will be using seperate files for the components instead of just having them all in one file, which sounds exciting. I really liked how you could I/O in Python, and I hope it's the same for jsx.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Concepts, tools, “aha” moments

### 🛠️ What I Built
- Features added, bugs fixed

### 🧨 What Confused Me
- Weird bugs, new syntax, broken docs

### ✅ How I Solved It / What I Realized
- Explain it like future-you is dumb

### 📌 Next Up
- TODOs for tomorrow
