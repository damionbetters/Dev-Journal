#### Bro, today was super hard to get back in the work groove. But I took 15 minutes to play sudoku and that got my focus back on track.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Building a layout for my list app
- Rendering list items
- Forms and handling submissions
- Controlled elements
- State vs.. Props

### 🛠️ What I Built
- Started on my Travel bag items app

### 🧨 What Confused Me
- Creating an array of 1-20 for the options of a dropdown list
- The syntax of the array usage

### ✅ How I Solved It / What I Realized
- I straight up asked chatgpt and felt dumb afterwards
- It's basically a for loop with Reacts version of Pythonic syntax or Reacty syntax. 

### 📌 Next Up
- TODOs for tomorrow
