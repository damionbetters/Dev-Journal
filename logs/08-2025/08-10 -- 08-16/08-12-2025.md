#### Today was a short workday, I could only work like four hours because I have to take my pops to Temple for a doctor's appointment. But, I still had enough time to go over a little more than half of the section over JS essentials. I wanted to do that and rewatch the lifting state vids again, but I may have time when I get back to finish up everything today. I must say focus and energy levels are still high today. That full "rest" day worked wonders. I would have normally been super tired today. I'm not one for the spotlight, but someone should really do a video on "rest' days. It really does work.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Deconstructing objects
- Deconstructing arrays
- Rest/spread operator
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Ternary Operations

### 🛠️ What I Built
- Today was a review/rewatch day

### 🧨 What Confused Me
- N/A

### ✅ How I Solved It / What I Realized
- There is no harm in doing review materials in courses, it will only bolster what you already know and/or remind you of things you may have forgotten.
- I didn't use it, so I lost it. 😭😭.
- Spaced repitition should have been used, especially on things that I will constantly use irl.

### 📌 Next Up
- Array map(), filter(), sort(), and reduce() methods
- Working with immutable arrays
- Promises, async, await (these I know but will review anyone since it is part of the course material.
