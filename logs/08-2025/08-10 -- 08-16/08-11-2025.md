#### Today was wild bro. I thought I had things figured out but I do not. I did not understand the whole lifting up and why. It's pretty simple once you think about it but for some reason it wasting clicking at first. And it still kinda isn't. The lifting up part is super simple, using the current state in one component and using the update the state part in another component is super easy as well; but, when it comes to passing the items as props and how to delete and how to add and how to update, thats where I got lost. And I think it's because my JS is flawed not my jsx. But having that day of rest yesterday and taking my breaks today did wonders for my focus and energy today. I think this is the longest day I ever worked. Plus, no children were around.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Lifting Up State
- Child-to-Parent Communication
- Complex immutable data operations
- Finished learning controlled elements and state vs props

### 🛠️ What I Built
- Delete item from list feature
- Checkbox to mark the element as packed
- Rendered newly added items in the PackingList component

### 🧨 What Confused Me
- Trying to add and delete items which involved child-to-parent communication and working with immutable objects

### ✅ How I Solved It / What I Realized
- I did not. I will figure that out tomorrow

### 📌 Next Up
- Review essential JavaScript for React
- rewatch adding, deleting, and updating items in Jonas' course
